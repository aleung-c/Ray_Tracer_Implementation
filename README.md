# RTv1
The beginning of an Ray_tracing implementation in C.

- WORK IN PROGRESS -

 This project implements a ray tracing algorithm using a low level display library. In fact, our school's display library lets us create a window of a defined size and put hexa colored pixels in it.
 In this version of the project, only the sphere algorithm is implemented, the rest is to come later.
